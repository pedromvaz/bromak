# bromak

**bromak** is a multiplayer web game that takes place in a fantasy world. Players start off with one Champion and its community,
in the stone age, and their aim is to make this community evolve through the ages by guiding and helping them through quests.

The world will be filled with different communities, from different races, and players may choose to befriend or attack them,
start alliances or wage wars.

**bromak** is a living, breathing world that continues to evolve even without players' interactions. And, unlike most games,
player actions *will make a difference* in the world, no matter how small.
